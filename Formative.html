      The Great Green Wall is an initiative that is based in Africa to combat climate change. The
       aim is to plant a wall of trees 8,000 km long and 15 km wide to combat desertification in Africa. When
        the Great Green Wall is finished it will be the largest living structure on the planet. Located in Sahel 
        on the southern border of the Sahara desert the Great Green Wall has helped in many other ways on top of 
        combatting climate change helping the lives of people living in the Sehal region. The Great Green Wall is an ambitous 
        project which is aiming to have a massive impact in Africa and worldwide. The aim of this website is to educate you about
        the project, the benefits of the Great Green Wall, the history behind it and the future of the Great Green Wall.

    <h1 class="display-3 text-center">The History of the Great Green Wall</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
    <p id="history">
      The reason for the creation of the Great Green Wall dates back to the 1970s when lots of the fertile land in the 
      Sahel started to become severly degraded meaning there was a lot less fertile land. This was cause by a combination
      of factors. The land went dry and barren due to the combined effects of climate change, population growth
      and unsustainable land management practices. Barren land helped create a cycle of poverty due to a lack of land
      to grow food on, mass unemployment, conflict over natural resources, water shortages and forced migration.
      To combat this ideas that would be built on which would eventually turn into the Great Green Wall were in thought around the 1980s.
      In 2007 this idea was finally finialised under the leadership of the African Union and was signed by 11 African countries.
      Since then over 20 countries have signed up to the project and is developing everyday.

      To help propell this project into the future the Great Green Wall multi-actor Accelerator (GGW Accelerator) was announced by the President of France Emmanuel Macron 
      and other world leaders at the One Planet Summit on January 11th, 2021. This is an initiative to help accelerate 
      the process of the Great Green Wall speed up. The main aim is to <a href="https://www.greatgreenwall.org/great-green-wall-accelerator">"help all actors for the Great Green Wall (GGW) Initiative to 
        better coordinate, monitor and measure the impact of their actions."</a> This will mean the project is much more likely
        to reach its intended outcome and with more and more trees planted every day. In turn this will help the day to day lives of people living in the Sehal
        region. The Accelerator has a five year plan from 2021 to 2025. The first step in 2021 is to design an GGW Online Platform for monitoring, tracking and connecting financing flows 
        with project needs and implementation results. Then from 2021 to 2022 support GGW countries with monitoring and reporting systems for the GGW. At the same time from 2021 to
        2023 check the implementation progress against the targets that have been set by the GGW. After this the Accelerator unit will
        be transferred to the Pan African Agency. Finally the last step planned for now is to review and evaluate the impact of the Accelerator investments.
